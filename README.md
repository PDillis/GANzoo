# Flatland
Generative models (VAEs and GANs) in one (sometimes two) dimmensions in  order to better explain their mechanics. Whenever some work is inspired by previous work, it will be duly credited.

For now, most of the code will focus on using PyTorch, but if possible (and given enough time), I will expand it to other frameworks, such as Keras/TensorFlow.
